title: "Data Structures are just Functions"
---

I was talking to my roommate about how all data structures are just function compositions
the other day so I thought I'd prove it.

One of the most versatile data structures is a map, and a map is practically a function already.
Sometimes, when we talk about functions, we talk about how they map their
domain to their range.

Here's a simple map as a function:

```
map = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
f('a') = 1
f('b') = 2
f('c') = 3
```

This is all pretty straightforward in mathematical notation, but obviously
this isn't real code.

I'll start with Python. An empty map is pretty easy to represent as a Python function:

```
empty_map = lambda _: None
```
It's just a function which takes any value and returns None.

It's also pretty easy to create a one variable map as a Python function:
```
simple_map = lambda x: 1 if x == 'a' else None
```

But how do we go about adding variables to this map? It's easy, just add an if statement:
```
new_map = lambda x: 2 if x == 'b' else simple_map(x)
```

If we take `new_map('b')`, it evaluates right to 2. If we take `new_map('a')`, it
evaluates `simple_map('a')`, which is just 1.

Now we can draw the rest of the owl:
```py
empty_map = lambda _: None

def insert(m, k, v):
    return lambda fetched_key: v if fetched_key == k else m(fetched_key)

def remove(m, k):
    return lambda fetched_key: None if fetched_key == k else m(fetched_key)
```

To insert a key into an existing map function, we just add a new 
if statement to the recursion stack. I think it's something that's simpler
to understand through code than English. A diagram would probably be helpful but
I'm bad at drawing.

Using this code is pretty straightforward:
```py
m = empty_map
m = insert(m, 1, "a")
print(m(1)) # a

m = insert(m, 2, "b")
m = insert(m, 3, "a")
m = insert(m, 1, "c")
print(m(1), m(2), m(3)) # c b a

m = remove(m, 2)
print(m(1), m(2), m(3)) # c None a
```

If only Python had a pipe operator, this would look a lot nicer.

Regardless, it's pretty easy to make a map out of just functions. I think
it's evident that any other data structure can be represented by a map, not
counting the performance characteristics.

Since I wrote these and don't really have anywhere to fit them in the post,
here's the same concept illustrated in Elixir and Haskell.

```elixir
defmodule FnMap do
  def empty_map, do: fn _ -> nil end

  def insert(m, k, v) do
    fn fetched_k ->
      if fetched_k == k, do: v, else: m.(fetched_k)
    end
  end

  def remove(m, k) do
    fn fetched_k ->
      if k == fetched_k, do: nil, else: m.(fetched_k)
    end
  end
end

m = FnMap.empty_map()
    |> FnMap.insert(1, "a")
    |> FnMap.insert(2, "b")
    |> FnMap.insert(3, "c")

{m.(1), m.(2), m.(3)} |> IO.inspect() # {"a", "b", "c"}
```

```haskell
newMap :: a -> Maybe b
newMap = \_ -> Nothing

insert :: (Eq a) => (a -> Maybe b) -> a -> b -> (a -> Maybe b)
insert f k v = 
    \fetched_key -> if fetched_key == k 
                       then Just v 
                       else f fetched_key

remove :: (Eq a) => (a -> Maybe b) -> a -> (a -> Maybe b)
remove f k =
    \fetched_key -> if fetched_key == k
                     then Nothing 
                     else f fetched_key

makeListMap :: [a] -> (Int -> Maybe a)
makeListMap ls = helper ls 0
    where helper [] _ = newMap
          helper (x:xs) i = insert (helper xs (i + 1)) i x

main = do
    let m = makeListMap "abcdefg"
--  [Just 'a',Just 'b',Just 'c',Just 'd',Just 'e',Just 'f',Just 'g']
    putStrLn $ show $ map m [0..6]
```
