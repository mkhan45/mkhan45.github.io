Since a few weeks ago, I've been trying to advertise [my tutoring website](https://www.kryptontutors.com). I started the site a few weeks ago with the goal of getting 5-10 students for a few friends and I. 

Our initial idea was to just set up the site, buy $10-20 of Facebook ads for our first few customers, and let word of mouth do the rest. We made a Facebook Page and a pamphlet and started looking into the ad center. Facebook's estimate was that for $15, we could get ~40 clicks a day for 4 days. Given the super detailed, highly creepy audience targeting that's available, we thought we could get at least one student every 100 clicks. It seemed like a great deal; $15 for a single student is pretty damn good assuming they stay for more than one lesson.

Unfortunately, things didn't turn out as well as Facebook's estimate told us it would. After 2 days, we'd spent $8 of the $15 budget and gotten a grand total of 6 clicks. At a rate of more than a dollar a click, we'd have to spend $100 for a single student by our estimates.

We went back to the drawing board and asked around for advice. Some other friends told us that they'd gotten all their customers just by posting in Facebook groups. We decided to try it, and unlie the paid ads, it went pretty well.

Looking for Facebook groups that allow self promotion was pretty tedious. Most groups which allow self promotion are predictably filled with ads and many get >100 posts a day, so I somewhat doubted that anyone would really see it. I posted in around 5-6 groups a day for a few days, and, by the end of the week, I'd almost given up. By the next week, though, we'd gotten our first student. A few weeks later, after posting on various other sites like Nextdoor, Craigslist, etc., all of our students are still from Facebook posts.

Advertising through Facebook groups obviously isn't perfect. I've probably posted in most of the relevant groups and we still only get around one email a week. Luckily for us, though, we don't need that many students (feel free to [contact us](https://www.kryptontutors.com/contactus) if you're interested though). Posting in Facebook groups is super tedious and surprisingly time consuming. Additionally, it's pretty difficult to tell what you're doing right or what mistakes you're making since there's no fancy analytics.

I guess that the traditional way to advertise small tutoring businesses is to post flyers around the local libraries and and schools. That's obviously not possible right now though. The common knowledge is that Facebook ads are the best way to cheaply advertise a small business online, but for a tiny tutoring company run by unemploed highschoolers, it seems like a different form of Facebook advertising is the way to go.
