title: "Backfire G2"
---

My Backfire G2 arrived today. I've been longboarding since quarantine started and inline skating since before then, but this is my first electric skateboard.

- It's a lot heavier than expected but I think I'll get used to it
- Pushing it manually feels kind of awkward at first since it's heavy and high
- Zoom zoom
- Eco mode is pretty chill. The acceleration from a dead stop takes a little bracing but if you push once or twice first it's really subtle
- The turning radius is about half a mile, but after loosening the trucks it'll probably be reasonable
- Sport mode feels dangerous at first but it's amazing how fast eco mode's 15 mph starts to feel slow
- I went to Dunkin Donuts and when I was leaving I got on backwards and it zoomed out from below me lol
- I'll probably mark the front
- Being able to brake is really nice. My neighborhood has lots of steep hills
- The range should be ~12 miles based on my weight and there's a lot of stuff within 6 miles of home so I don't see range being an issue
- I wonder how well riding it as a normal skateboard + brakes works for when it runs out of battery
- very fun
